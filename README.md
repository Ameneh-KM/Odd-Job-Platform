# Odd-Job-Platform

In this report we present our soulution to the Odd Job Platform system for software engineering module assignment. We decided to implement the server-side backend in node.js using express and cors. For managing the authentication, JSON Web Token (JTW) were implemented. The server connects to a locally hosted mysql database, to access available users and projects and let’s users register, login, access all available projects and create new projects.
