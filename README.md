# Odd-Job-Platform Using React and Nodejs

In this project we present our soulution to the Odd Job Platform system for software engineering module assignment. We decided to implement the server-side backend in node.js using express and cors. For managing the authentication, JSON Web Token (JTW) were implemented. The server connects to a locally hosted mysql database, to access available users and projects and letâ€™s users register, login, access all available projects and create new projects.
